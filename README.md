# DatarepPythonAnywhere
I have created and changed to a new repo during this project,https://github.com/G00387859/DATA-REPRESENTATION-AND-QUERY, https://github.com/G00387859/DATA-REPRESENTATION-AND-QUERYING because I had trouble updating https://github.com/G00387859/DATA-REPRESENTATION-AND-QUERYING so I created https://github.com/G00387859/DATA-REPRESENTATION-AND-QUERY and then I though that it would be a better project submission to have only the project code. so I create this one.<br/>
This contains the project.<br/> 	
In this project the objectivate to create a rest_server and repersent data from backend mysql table.<br/> 
The rest server uses flask<br/>
While the code runs on python anywhere I could not get the backend database to stay connected even when I applied the changes made in the optional lectures and reverted as did not make a difference. I guess I have to use the SQLALCHEMY, which I have not done for the submission. If the session on pythonanywhere fallover, and it will, the code is identical to the code in the project.<br/>
I have a login page which is simiular to a login page for w3 schools referenced in the code. I have added to the repo a document that shows the pythonanyhere working.
