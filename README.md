# DatarepPythonAnywhere
This contains the project 	
In this project the objectivate to create a rest_server and repersent data from backend mysql table. 
The rest server uses flask.
While the code runs on python anywhere I could not get the backend database to stay connected even when I applied the changes made in the optional lectures and reverted as did not make a difference. I guess I have to use the SQLALCHEMY, which I have not done for the submission. If the session on pythonanywhere fallover, and i will, the code is identical to the code in the project.
I have a login page which is simiular to a login page for w3 schools referenced in the code. I have added to the repo a document that shows the pythonanyhere working.
